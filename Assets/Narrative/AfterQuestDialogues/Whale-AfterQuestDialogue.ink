Hey, whale! Thought I'd swing by and see how you're doing. #speaker:Fox
Oh! Look who's back. Thanks for dropping by, friend. #speaker:Whale
No worries. How's the ocean treating you? #speaker:Fox
I've been exploring all sorts of new spots. #speaker:Whale
And those fruits you brought me really hit the spot! #speaker:Whale
Glad to hear it! Did you find anything exciting? #speaker:Fox
Ocean is full of surprises! #speaker:Whale
If you haven't already, you should swim across to the other side of our island! #speaker:Whale
I will do that! Thanks for the tip, catch you later! #speaker:Fox
Take care, fox friend. See you around! #speaker:Whale
