Hey! I'm a quest giving NPC. #speaker:Bob
This is a placeholder dialogue where I tell you that I need you to mine an ore for me.
And the ore is inside one of the rocks that will soon spawn behind us.
Use Rock Smash ability to locate it.
But I'm impatient. You have only couple of attempts before I made you start again.
