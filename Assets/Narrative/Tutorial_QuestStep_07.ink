As you can see, this is an enormous island. Many places to start your adventure. #speaker:Bear
However, there is one very special place. We call it Heart of Island.
Maybe it is better to show you. Then you understand the meaning of it.
Meet me there. Use the map, so you won’t get lost.
As you journey through the forest, keep an eye out for berry bushes. 
Berries grow all across the island, if you want you can try and collect them all! #variableChange:Tutorial_07
