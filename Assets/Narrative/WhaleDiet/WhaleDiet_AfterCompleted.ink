Hey, whale! Thought I'd swing by and see how you're doing. #speaker:Fox
Well, well, well! Look who's back. Thanks for dropping by, friend. #speaker:Whale
No worries. How's the ocean treating you? #speaker:Fox
Oh, you know, same old, same old. But those fruits you brought me really hit the spot. #speaker:Whale
FOX: Glad to hear it! And how's your swimming going? #speaker:Fox
Oh, I've been exploring all sorts of new spots. Ocean is full of surprises! #speaker:Whale
Awesome! Well, I'll leave you to it. Catch you later! #speaker:Fox
WHALE: Take care, fox friend. See you around! #speaker:Whale
