If it isn't my helpful fox friend! What brings you back? #speaker:Wolf
Just wanted to check in and make sure you found that bone alright. #speaker:Fox
Oh, I did indeed! Thanks to you, I had a delicious meal. #speaker:Wolf
Happy to help. And how's everything else going? #speaker:Fox
Actually, I've been up to something new. #speaker:Wolf
That sounds exciting! Discover anything cool? #speaker:Fox
Found a very festive tree the other day. You should try looking for it! #speaker:Wolf
Festive? I will keep that in mind. Take care, wolf friend. #speaker:Fox
