/*
    Pawprint Spawner Script

    Purpose:
    - Spawns a pawprint decal at the location of a trigger collider when it enters a collision.
    - Uses raycasting to ensure the pawprint is placed on the terrain.

    What Still Needs to Be Done:
    - **Correct Rotation:** Pawprints do not currently align with the character’s movement direction.
    - **Conditional Spawning:** Pawprints should only appear on specific terrain textures (e.g., dirt, sand, snow).
    - **Placement Verification:** Ensure pawprints do not clip into the ground or float above the surface.

    Notes:
    - This system is currently a **basic implementation** to visualize footprints.
    - Programmers need to refine the logic for terrain detection and correct rotation.
